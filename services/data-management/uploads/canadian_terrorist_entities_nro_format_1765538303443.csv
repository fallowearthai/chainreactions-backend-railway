764,2025-121,Terrorist Organization,"764 is a decentralized transnational network of online nihilistic violent extremists, whose core beliefs are rooted in misanthropy (a hatred of humanity or the human race) and nihilism (the rejection of all religious, moral and social values, often accompanied by a belief that life is meaningless.). 764 members engage in criminal conduct around the world, seeking to destroy civilized society through violence and chaos, not as a step towards a new ""state"" but rather as an end itself. Members routinely use various social media and gaming platforms, particularly those with young and marginalized user bases, to lure, groom, and extort youth to commit violent and sexual acts, including self-harm. 764 members view sexual, psychological, and physical violence as entertainment, a way to achieve status and notoriety in-group, and ideological labour to erode social norms. 764 members disseminate instructional materials on how to effectively carry out these activities while avoiding detection. Elements of the network have increasingly focused on encouraging offline acts of violence. In February 2024, a 14-year-old 764 member from Alberta was charged with multiple offences, including child pornography and explosives-related crimes. Authorities allege the minor was active in extremist group chats and shared disturbing online content involving violence, weapons, self-harm, and sexual exploitation material. On January 4, 2025, a minor linked to 764 attacked a 55-year-old woman with a knife in Sweden, causing nonfatal injuries. The minor uploaded the video of the attack to social media from a 764-linked account. In January 2025, a teenager allegedly involved in the 764 network pled guilty to encouraging suicide, possessing a terrorism manual, and possessing child sexual abuse material in the United Kingdom.",,2025-12-08,Not yet reviewed,http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/cntr-trrrsm/lstd-ntts/crrnt-lstd-ntts-en.aspx

FARC activities include bombings, hijackings, assassinations, and the kidnapping of Colombian officials and Westerners. In September 2016, FARC entered into a demobilization process with the Colombian government and signed a Peace Accord which formally brought an end to 52 years of armed conflict.

The Colombian Government has recognized that demobilized FARC members who adhere to the commitments under the 2016 Peace Accord would no longer be labelled as terrorists. In January 2021, the FARC political party changed its name to Comunes and accordingly, Comunes is not captured by this listing. While the vast majority of FARC combatants have demobilized and participate in the peace process, it is important to recognize that certain groups refused to disarm and claim to be the true continuation of FARC. For example, in August 2019, a FARC commander, Iván Márquez, called on his followers to re-take up arms, announcing a “new phase of the armed struggle” and asserting that the guerrilla group carries the same: FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People's Army).

RIM leaders intended the WNCM to facilitate the sharing of tactical skills across peer organizations and promote their own paramilitary training program. Furthermore, RIM has donated money to foreign neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups associated with the WNCM and provided training to members who have carried out bomb plots in their own countries. In 2016, RIM provided training to two Swedes who then bombed a bookstore café, a refugee shelter, and a campground that housed asylum seekers.

Taliban,53,Terrorist Organization,"The Taliban are an Islamic fundamentalist political movement in Afghanistan. The Taliban's main objectives are the removal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan, and the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Since the Taliban takeover and establishment of their de facto authority in 2021, the Taliban have refocused their efforts on internal cohesion and demonstrating authority domestically. The Taliban has used terrorist tactics, including the extensive use of improvised explosive devices and suicide bombings, to further their political objectives and are known to attack civilian targets, government compounds, military targets in built-up urban areas, as well as infrastructure projects. In 2011, the Taliban were responsible for the majority of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and carried out a number of attacks on girls' schools in particular. In January 2018, the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul which utilized an ambulance as a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device to kill at least 95 people and wound more than 150. The Taliban have publicly carried out widespread and systemic violence, including beatings, torture, forced amputation, forced disappearances, public executions, and extrajudicial killings. In July 2020, a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the Shah Wali Kot police district headquarters in Kandahar. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack that killed three police officers and wounded at least 14 others, both civilians and police. Both before and after the formation of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban have focused on the targeting of civilians for moral and political offences. This includes severe restrictions on women and girls in all aspects of public life, including dress code, education and employment, as well as strict enforcement of religious observance, such as attendance for men in mosques at prayer time. Public floggings and executions have become a common occurrence again since their reintroduction following the takeover in 2021. For example, in December 2022, 27 men and women were publicly flogged in a stadium in the northern province of Parwan on a variety of charges and in June 2024, 63 men and women were publicly flogged in the northern Sari Pul province.",Afghan Taliban; Movement of Islamic Students; Taleban; Islamic Movement of the Taliban (De Talebano Islami Ghurdzang or Tehrik); the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (De Afghanistan Islami Emarat),2013-05-09,2024-06-07,http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/cntr-trrrsm/lstd-ntts/crrnt-lstd-ntts-en.aspx
Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),54,Terrorist Organization,"The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was founded in December 2007 as an umbrella organization for pro-Taliban groups operating mostly in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North West Frontier Province), Pakistan. It was led, first, by militant commander Baitullah Mehsud and, following his death, by Hakimullah Mehsud. The TTP aims to create a Taliban-style Islamic emirate under Sharia law, beginning in Pakistan's tribal areas and later extending to include Muslims elsewhere. The TTP strives to unite pro-Taliban groups in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and looked to assist the Afghan Taliban in their campaign against former President Karzai and international forces in Afghanistan. In 2018, the TTP redirected its fighters away from indiscriminately attacking civilian and religious minorities, advocating instead for targeted violence against the Pakistan’s military personnel and intelligence operatives. Additionally, in 2020, the TPP reduced their regional and global aspiration, rather focusing on their war with the Pakistani state. The TTP has conducted numerous armed, bomb and suicide attacks to achieve its objectives. The TTP has also engaged in criminal activity, such as extortion, theft, robbery and kidnapping for ransom to support its terrorist operations. The TTP maintains links to Al Qaida, Lashka-e-Jahngvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed, all listed terrorist groups under Canada's Criminal Code. Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Afghan Taliban released hundreds of TTP militants from prisons in Kabul. The TTP publicly renewed its pledge of allegiance to the Afghan Taliban and has since enjoyed operational freedom in Afghanistan. On May 23, 2023, at least 50 TTP militants targeted an oil and gas exploration site in Mainji Khel, Pakistan, killing four personnel and two private guards.",Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan; Tehrik-I-Taliban Pakistan; Tehrik-e-Taliban; Pakistani Taliban; Tehreek-e-Taliban; Tehrik Taliban-I-Pakistan; Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan; Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan,2011-07-05,2024-06-07,http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/cntr-trrrsm/lstd-ntts/crrnt-lstd-ntts-en.aspx
