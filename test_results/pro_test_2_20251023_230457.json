{"result":"Risk Item: 中国工程物理研究院\\nInstitution A: 山东大学核科学与能源动力学院\\nRelationship Type: Direct\\nFinding Summary: Evidence reveals a direct and multi-faceted relationship between Shandong University, including its School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, and the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), spanning personnel exchanges, official collaborations, and joint research publications.\n\n(1) Personnel Connections:\n- **Ongoing:** The China Academy of Engineering Physics is a significant employer of Shandong University graduates. The university's 2018 and 2019 graduate employment quality reports list CAEP as a key employer of its students. (STRONG)\n- **Ongoing:** Wang Qi, a researcher and doctoral supervisor at the CAEP Materials Research Institute, is an alumnus of Shandong University's School of Materials. (STRONG)\n- **2019-Present:** Boqun Liu, a PhD student in the laser-nuclear physics group at CAEP, is a 2019 bachelor's graduate of Shandong University. (STRONG)\n- **Prior Affiliation:** Zhang Peng, a researcher at Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, previously worked at the CAEP's Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry. (STRONG)\n\n(2) Joint Projects & Organizational Ties:\n- **2017 (and prior):** During a high-level visit from a Shandong University delegation to CAEP in July 2017, CAEP's Vice President, Zhang Ke, stated that the two institutions have maintained a close cooperative relationship. He specifically mentioned that the \"Shenguang III\" facility (a high-power laser facility for fusion research) had been cooperating with Shandong University's State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials for many years. (STRONG)\n- **2017:** During the same visit, both sides expressed a desire to enhance future cooperation in joint graduate student training, scientific research collaboration, and student internships. (MODERATE)\n\n(3) Publications:\n- **2025 (Forthcoming):** A paper scheduled for publication in the March 2025 issue of the journal \"Infrared and Laser Engineering\" is co-authored by researchers from Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics and CAEP's Institute of Fluid Physics. (STRONG)\n\n(4) Events:\n- **July 2017:** A Shandong University delegation, led by Deputy Party Secretary Tong Xinghua, visited CAEP in Mianyang, Sichuan. The purpose of the visit was to thank CAEP for its support in employing and training SDU students and to discuss further collaboration. (STRONG)\n\n(5) Media & Significant Mentions:\n- **December 2020:** A report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) noted that Shandong University \"works on China's nuclear weapons program and houses several Chinese defense laboratories,\" placing it in a similar national security context as CAEP. (WEAK)\n- **Undated:** Shandong University's New Generation Semiconductor Materials Research Institute lists CAEP as a key partner with whom it has in-depth cooperation.
