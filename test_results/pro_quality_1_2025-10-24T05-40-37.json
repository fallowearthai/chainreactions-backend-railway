  "result": "Risk Item: 中国工程物理研究院\\nInstitution A: 山东大学核科学与能源动力学院\\nRelationship Type: Direct\\nFinding Summary: The relationship between Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics and the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) is direct and primarily centered on a formalized and long-standing talent and recruitment pipeline. Evidence spans personnel connections, organizational agreements, and joint participation in academic events.\n\n(1) **Personnel Connections & Recruitment:**\n- **October 12 (Year unspecified):** Shandong University and CAEP held a \"Talent Cooperation Symposium\" on campus. This event established an online \"Shandong University·CAEP Talent Introduction Green Channel\" to streamline the recruitment process for Shandong University graduates. During the event, a CAEP Human Resources official was appointed as a \"Student Career Development Mentor\" at the university. This establishes a formal, ongoing recruitment relationship. (STRONG)\n- **October 12 (Year unspecified):** Following the symposium, CAEP held a dedicated recruitment talk for students, attracting over 100 graduates. This was part of Shandong University's \"Fifth Service for National Strategic Needs Talent Introduction and Recruitment Month.\" (STRONG)\n- **Historical Alumni Link:** At the symposium, a Shandong University official noted that over one hundred alumni from the university are employed at CAEP, indicating a significant and historical personnel pipeline. (MODERATE)\n- **2019:** Shandong University's Physics School (a related faculty) organized a summer employment practice program for 30 graduate students to visit CAEP in Mianyang, further encouraging students to seek employment at the institute. (MODERATE)\n- **2019:** A recruitment fair held at Shandong University on March 12, 2019, listed CAEP's Computer Application Research Institute as a participating employer seeking Master's and PhD graduates. (MODERATE)\n- **2015:** A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) references a 2015 article from Shandong University about a CAEP recruitment event, titled 'Smelting a keystone for national defence, serving as a national backbone—Recording the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics' 2015 university recruitment event'. (MODERATE)\n- **2011:** Zhang Peng (张鹏), a professor at the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, has a past affiliation with CAEP's Nuclear Physics and Chemistry Institute, where he delivered an oral report in November 2011. (WEAK)\n\n(2) **Events:**\n- **June 22-26, 2025:** Both Shandong University and the China Academy of Engineering Physics are listed as participating organizations in the 32nd International Conference on Nuclear Engineering (ICONE32) to be held in Weihai, Shandong. (MODERATE)\n- **November 25, 2024:** Both institutions were mentioned as participants in the \"First International Exchange Conference on Digital and Intelligent Nuclear Energy\" held in Beijing. (MODERATE)\n- **October 31 - November 2, 2025:** Representatives from both Shandong University and the China Academy of Engineering Physics are listed on the academic committee for the 20th National Youth Materials Science and Technology Symposium in Nanjing. (WEAK)\n\n(3) **Significant Mention:**\n- A 2020 report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) on China's defense technology workforce identifies Shandong University as a key university and the China Academy of Engineering Physics as a major defense employer, implicitly linking the university as a talent feeder for the defense sector. (WEAK)\n\n(4) **Publications:**\n- No evidence of directly co-authored publications between the two specific institutions was found in the search. However, researchers from both institutions publish in the same specialized journals, such as those indexed by the VIP (维普) database, indicating overlapping research interests.
