Shandong University's 2018 and 2019 graduate employment quality reports explicitly list CAEP as a key employer for graduates pursuing careers in scientific research and technical services. (STRONG)\n- October 12, 2021: Shandong University and CAEP held a \"Talent Cooperation Symposium\" and a campus recruitment event. During the event, the two parties established an online \"Shandong University-CAEP Talent Introduction Green Channel\" to facilitate recruitment. CAEP's HR department head was also appointed as a student career development mentor at Shandong University. (STRONG)\n- Alumni Link: Xue Qiao, a researcher at CAEP's Laser Fusion Research Center, received his Master's degree from Shandong University in 2010 before pursuing his PhD at Tsinghua University and joining CAEP. (MODERATE)\n\n(2) Joint Projects:\n- March 22, 2024: Shandong University and the CAEP Chemical Materials Research Institute (中物院化工材料研究所) were announced as joint undertaking units for the National Key R&D Program project titled \"Research on the Preparation and Application of Large-Size Nonlinear Optical Crystals and Devices\". This indicates collaboration on nationally significant, strategic research. (STRONG)\n\n(3) Publications:\n- 2025 (Forthcoming): A paper is scheduled for publication in Volume 54, Issue 3 of the journal \"Infrared and Laser Engineering\" (红外与激光工程) co-authored by researchers from the Shandong University School of Nuclear Science and Technology (山东大学核科学与能源动力学院) and the CAEP Institute of Fluid Physics (中国工程物理研究院流体物理研究所). (STRONG)\n\n(4) Events:\n- August 2023: Both Shandong University and a CAEP institute (Nuclear Physics and Chemistry Research Institute) participated in the 22nd National Annual Conference on Nuclear Electronics and Nuclear Detection Technology, with the CAEP representative discussing the development of high-performance nuclear electronics equipment. (MODERATE)\n- July 2011: Zhang Peng, a researcher from the Shandong University School of Nuclear Science and Technology, delivered an oral presentation at the \"International Workshop on the Application of Neutron Scattering in Condensed Matter Physics\" held at the CAEP's Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry. (MODERATE)\n\n(5) Funding:\n- No specific evidence of direct funding from CAEP to Shandong University was found. However, the joint participation in the National Key R&D Program implies shared government funding for collaborative work.
