Shandong University works with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), which is China's national development facility for nuclear warheads, to develop nuclear weapons. The university reportedly has a number of defense laboratories linked to China's nuclear weapons program. Furthermore, Shandong University has an agreement with the Chinese military's academy of military science for joint military research.

In November 2018, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) National Defense University's Military Management College conducted on-site teaching at Shandong University, where a university official highlighted the institution's focus on ties with national defense and the military. In September 2013, a National Defense Education Base was inaugurated at the Jinan Civilian Militia Training Center, further demonstrating institutional involvement in military-related education. The establishment of the Shandong University Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology in May 2023, focusing on key nuclear technology research, reinforces the university's strategic role in a field with clear dual-use potential.","potential_intermediary_B":"State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), People's Liberation Army (PLA) National Defense University","sources":[{"id":1,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE6jtu46lSzUkH3wK8eX_TQx-kSkWPucS61ipnTrfYRidkwyVQH3WIkP64jO-pfO57Hu9eOqNwGLr9gtGuJsoCuuBovJ1CUIx7K0xQFa8FhRgiJO_1-4or3zQzAUGUDVN_gU8p9vEub-w301Q3lbUFnpolNc-9v3Q5KBlmNXOEpBRCI9ARcIgIVI63JH70L2K4CTws6aKu8tVm2D7L7g_x5YK2yRIeMsE06uJ_nGbz4vqSCrv0KJ2ycUtfVCWtPL0p7qQQrRHxo8PN6sPXFqnsZ29ur8Y38idA3IgzPLQ=="},{"id":2,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGbyp9oD-rmbE4oGEuF9V-TqIVTBFl5Z_VdmT4EOrNBSvq0rDRxcolbmwbNrU4HJVLIXgQ4sufPIVi_ZeuZTsW3VPYcI-5SU_mYxZyZ1Ci3r166pj31BJte-Xi-yPFkk4b7fh0Ro8nqpTiiyv1O61ssVHy3P7-M8FBOycqItBTDPtuiTT1LkO_ks7zSnCL6s19qH1zIO675Jv4AoiIYgbU="},{"id":3,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGqkSHfbw00gyaYMktoQzYxTB31OMyyVQee5mAKQQ9KpliI3rI78WuHyYGgMLERR9QjdmeHmsdx8Gg8nMoH1jaRkUmOX1UHHjLeLXu_cBLf-DZH08SCdXwCFelMsQgOvf3U4hT8zQwR-cMNE5ae9QFpsltfBQ=="},{"id":4,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFCT2oX93XNEm5RlL4YNp9BD9mTrAzglkQleusU_FkYIVqo_CFAJmhxkKfjivTn9wvMW9ATlzCOKXKsJb5bRP1DznvooAvIhIQdSueB6IwG9-iEeI2KqONfX7d_Ol5IpBj1BdEnWsVJoJw="},{"id":5,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEMIhlyDF-my72ojUfBB_c5IJUXVAb3vliL7p1ks94HfxSjdjgrDW64FgrRikOORCEn8S3teYvuXcQrretuLotmP-I3Osf3BeIIzpgguFWJaeDG73NdpoNasMp-pPL40AXh907aVl-LK0oUFQ=="},{"id":6,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQExEjnTSV0nI1SjYSP0cJSjt-fP7KiUqrjxXsjEorSIyS1qI00pM_gmGczPK-KS8lPNRtlT3i-mWOpJDknT2KlKsNuxZXhrTifNI33KTDlrZ1W55FRzAts="},{"id":7,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFFvmyBsy3HzbwJ6FwSKBh9tr4-nai755ghbOLJYlUW51nmjc1lXqkbOCNfGOTwdDuzTwa_KXXnUulgldU4pfoWPRDG8BvGhqVGMl3K8LjFY0ImJa5MH8XkCn5Z2FOonGp45tZMiQ=="},{"id":8,"url":"https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG4ez87DpovvL3V1mhx_VJGqdgCgxyHNG8oYL4gT0cZ86j87yB_sj2honj-rsuWEzIm3jXT3qc_GwfLjHI5oEyCrDgd8Y85UupSReYwPsgvhQkkckz016Z2SMg4srRCGoqC-Y8ShwNt_oZrBS5C7rJRxA=="}],"sources_count":8,"key_evidence":[{"text":"The university is overseen by the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), a Chinese government agency responsible for managing the country's defense industry","source_indices":[1]},{"text":"Shandong University works with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), which is China's national development facility for nuclear warheads, to develop nuclear weapons","source_indices":[1,2]},{"text":"The university reportedly has a number of defense laboratories linked to China's nuclear weapons program","source_indices":[2,3,4]},{"text":"Furthermore, Shandong University has an agreement with the Chinese military's academy of military science for joint military research","source_indices":[3,4]},{"text":"The university has also established a \\\"Science and Technology Innovation Military-Civil Fusion Research Institute\\\" (科技创新军民融合研究院) and a \\\"military-civilian talent training center\\\" (军民人才培养中心), indicating a formal commitment to military-civilian integration","source_indices":[5,6]},{"text":"In November 2018, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) National Defense University's Military Management College conducted on-site teaching at Shandong University, where a university official highlighted the institution's focus on ties with national defense and the military","source_indices":[5]},{"text":"In September 2013, a National Defense Education Base was inaugurated at the Jinan Civilian Militia Training Center, further demonstrating institutional involvement in military-related education","source_indices":[7]},{"text":"The establishment of the Shandong University Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology in May 2023, focusing on key nuclear technology research, reinforces the university's strategic role in a field with clear dual-use potential","source_indices":[8]}],"formatted_display":{"result":"Risk Item: Military\\nInstitution A: School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, Shandong University\\nRelationship Type: Direct\\nFinding Summary: Shandong University, which houses the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, has direct and significant connections to the Chinese military and defense sector.
