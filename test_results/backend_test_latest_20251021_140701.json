{"result":"Risk Item: Military\\nInstitution A: School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, Shandong University\\nRelationship Type: Direct\\nFinding Summary: Shandong University, which includes the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, has documented direct and indirect connections to China's military and nuclear weapons programs. The university has 'defence laboratories linked to China's nuclear weapons programme' and 'works with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) to develop nuclear weapons'. It is also stated that Shandong University works with the 'Chinese Academy of Elements, China's national development facility for nuclear warheads'.\n\nFurthermore, Shandong University is 'overseen by the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND)' and is listed as one of 16 'co-construction universities or quasi-seven military-affiliated universities' managed by SASTIND, which are 'connected deeply with Chinese arms industry and the PLA'. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) has rated Shandong University as 'Very High Risk' due to its 'links to China's nuclear weapons program'.\n\nShandong University explicitly promotes 'military-civilian integration' (军民融合) as a strategic development goal. The university also has a dedicated 'Science and Technology Innovation Military-Civil Fusion Research Institute' (山东大学科技创新军民融合研究院). The establishment of the Shandong University Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology in December 2022, in cooperation with Fenglin Nuclear Group, focuses on advanced nuclear energy science and engineering and nuclear technology applications, which, in the broader context of SDU's military links, suggests potential dual-use applications. The formal unveiling of the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power in November 2024 further emphasizes the university's commitment to national energy strategy and highlights its historical connection to figures who contributed to national nuclear industry development.\\nIntermediary B: Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), Chinese Academy of Elements, State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), Fenglin Nuclear Group","urls":"1. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEuqxrsnDWJqj739lvQ6_2LTLkE766ok0WZl-xO18OSeGpUDM_97qpn_1CiTjFKbqY3VlcxTC3qBjuuRm14mw2KVvBhZahS4vrzyURs1sAk9_WA23AAnJrnNFOLofxJvkQAgmuWPnDQnSaX78LebBvEE105iErIIXAvub4MkWuxtNAQkpj7A3-vwQT_75rxXR3sAqr_AMx9VzfWIWuQmw==\\n2. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFQ2lGOrriuXSa4EGlz40-ch0wAO8VNqF5RJawxZCAlK_ToVI7KpzndD-Bmcoup8P4JEcX2_iMSIIw0ecJcJeHZ2CyeCU6uB-oaXwjLJPjj82d1CZCNLjeJkDRsYStizxaqnDOIkVjqx2setHadNYLowFdDi_C4QBA-YIZTnIa1MmDe56ph0Y6k7TuDFvc8kvFsmc_NO-dr8_-yF4JAGhLjqLV2tvRw7_Hom69FIHpy9HwMNi_HRKKWojv1q4ICrCMCviqb_sQGI7AuNWlKIGqNsq2NFUlchr6gOftP\\n3. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHeaHjv6BqLNPt1bA_twV7CNn5dEpDnQIjcLyENL48ohI1z6gIzSD5cbqQ7mwXkYOF8xmpr1oj8oUdo8k5Svrkh5x_T6qOHdh9OYH46ZUBV2XJXvoR7LeNKgu8SF6A=\\n4. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFXjdt8ifTPOnAixIL5jFmXj5li4NuogAuLK3YXC-BBa5_LC3_1wmTpvH8edP3E_McPbmWRynINVLEEie7nZBLlvIXMYnOwdIeV55oIIV_dVE5ycpB87lS2xw9d4CPiGx1Zz3DJDy5aVohP012As0W8UeLOt09gju4=\\n5. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEVFEWGd02AvadBdCfpVhKCifmjuLWBYfmZ5GoqjcYhUc6VGLCxM6cNhKt7vYsb6dt7R465CNBc_vPlrxXf24tixQo4ei4Um-RnOeWgTt342YAOT9tz8R0CudU6h297FmA17wP9zt0=\\n6. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHjPjhc9AKXAG0zzYbiBv8I75NzEqGwvlYMx7iORNy0Iu_1RXsxPninwBOIzXHHFtshEdevUdehQ5y_2C3RxQv00Cf-FDy1jwd6ZR8eq3W-BJE105UCQg==\\n7. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQELmRsh5WMOWR0cIAWnEjgMRPnYactAo1caZYBVkD9IgysB9zahFn3adpqv2-ms3xDj1NY7_b7OCCtI3yULA63HE7_tIQFLW4tLWl2jRqe-zfo1elXXvK8zQYk6MjE2z73_yC8=\\n8. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGhuqPFETs4sy7NZTnDmjTe-NEwh4-pp_f9tC5enZd3dPF1bQscQBhr2Rymiiuymapz3B9et22t1-JTjq11JHCF9ZxXzcuswFM8LZoRyEQ49Y7xGSK6Ef_vJ7_RIK92rsRK0faisVvQ\\n9. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGp_r02IHMD51H0JXojOCgwtAm1-hhhnSSWqsQ9QoyzkErpCSZb03HzC62co0YeVQ-wcCXOd-YV2ugN6FEQpiPNPAKyvSwg9h1UMao4GirqyE79Oa4WUEvc4dLFOBcXgkJe5UuO8G1K\\n10. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFyvG920Nn04tPtGg_86iE4Sv0vZ7zofcIFPdi9l_-jdt9gCzJxUxgqiDVAsOZ2V8TQGwFMq3_iEx1mekTIG8pfiIkuQkgld9-UeA9VJgpBgK4h8kLX3GauxJxQMGQ5zjKPG4E1fDs-nBi9Dd19eW_WFxahHb1DidMe5n3XaUeeaSYh","raw_data":{"risk_item":"Military","institution_A":"School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, Shandong University","relationship_type":"Direct","finding_summary":"Shandong University, which includes the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, has documented direct and indirect connections to China's military and nuclear weapons programs.
