{"version":"2.1.0","success":true,"data":{"risk_item":"中国工程物理研究院","institution_A":"山东大学核科学与能源动力学院","relationship_type":"Direct","finding_summary":"(1) Personnel Connections: On October 12, 2023, Shandong University and the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) held a talent cooperation symposium and campus recruitment event. During the event, it was mentioned that over one hundred Shandong University alumni are employed at CAEP. The Director of Shandong University's Student Employment and Entrepreneurship Guidance Center, Xiao Xiang, was present, along with Feng Xuesong, Director of the Planning Office of CAEP's Human Resources Department, and HR managers from 11 of CAEP's institutes. An online \"Shandong University-CAEP Talent Introduction Green Channel\" was established. Additionally, Feng Xuesong was appointed as a student career development mentor at Shandong University. (STRONG). A faculty member profile for Zhang Peng at Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics lists participation in a 2011 academic exchange meeting at the Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry, China Academy of Engineering Physics. (MODERATE). A graduate from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics, who was jointly trained with Inner Mongolia University, is listed as having gone on to employment at the China Academy of Engineering Physics. This individual had previously obtained a bachelor's degree from Shandong University's School of Physics. (WEAK). \n\n(2) Joint Projects/Programs: In 2013 and 2014, Shandong University was listed as a higher education institution participating in a joint postgraduate training program with the China Academy of Engineering Physics. (STRONG). In May 2019, Shandong University's School of Physics issued a notice to select graduate students for a summer employment practice program at the China Academy of Engineering Physics in Mianyang, Sichuan. (STRONG). On July 24, 2018, the China Academy of Engineering Physics and Shandong University's School of Physics jointly launched a summer school. The program featured lectures by one National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars recipient and six young scholars from CAEP for undergraduate students. (STRONG).\n\n(3) Publications: A search for co-authored publications shows a paper published in \"Nanoscale\" on November 19, 2020, with authors affiliated with both Shandong University and the China Academy of Engineering Physics. (STRONG). A search on the VIP Chinese journal database shows authors from \"山东大学核科学与能源动力学院\" (School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, Shandong University) and authors from \"中国工程物理研究院\" (China Academy of Engineering Physics) have both published in various academic journals, though no direct co-authored papers from the specific school were immediately found in the snippets. (WEAK).\n\n(4) Events: On an unspecified date in 2024, the \"First International Exchange Conference on Digital and Intelligent Nuclear Energy\" was held in Beijing. Both Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics and the China Academy of Engineering Physics were listed among the participating organizations. (MODERATE).\n\n(5) Funding: No specific evidence of direct funding between the two institutions was found in the search results.\n\n(6) Media Reports: A December 2021 report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, cited by George Mason University, mentions that Shandong University works on China's nuclear weapons program. The same report notes that the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) is a center for nuclear weapons research. While this report discusses both entities in the context of defense-related research, it does not state a direct link or collaboration between them. (WEAK).\n\n(7) Organizational Ties: The China Academy of Engineering Physics is a regular recruiter at Shandong University, holding dedicated recruitment events and participating in talent cooperation symposiums, indicating a formal and ongoing relationship focused on personnel pipelines.
