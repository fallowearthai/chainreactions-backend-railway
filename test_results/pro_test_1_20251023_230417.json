{"result":"Risk Item: 中国工程物理研究院\\nInstitution A: 山东大学核科学与能源动力学院\\nRelationship Type: Direct\\nFinding Summary: Analysis of available data reveals direct, long-standing, and multi-faceted connections between Shandong University, including its School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, and the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP). The relationship encompasses personnel exchange (recruitment and alumni), joint research projects, and co-authored publications.\n\n(1) **Personnel (人员)**:\n- **Recruitment & Alumni**: CAEP actively recruits graduates from Shandong University. On October 12, 2021, CAEP's Human Resources Department held a talent cooperation symposium and campus recruitment event at Shandong University's central campus. The university noted that over 100 of its alumni work at CAEP. During the event, a \"Shandong University-CAEP Talent Introduction Green Channel\" was established to streamline the recruitment process. (MODERATE)\n- **Alumni in CAEP Graduate School**: Shandong University graduates continue their studies at CAEP. A 2019 employment quality report from Shandong University lists CAEP as a key destination for further education for its graduates. A webpage for CAEP's Laser-Nuclear Physics Group lists a Ph.D. student, Boqun Liu, who received his B.S. from Shandong University (2015-2019). (STRONG)\n- **Faculty Connections**: Zhiliang Qin, an Adjunct Distinguished Professor at Shandong University's School of Mechanics, Electrical and Information Engineering, received his M.Eng. degree from the Graduate School of CAEP in 1998. (MODERATE)\n- **Researcher Presentation**: Peng Zhang, from Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, gave an oral presentation at CAEP's Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry in Mianyang in December 2011. (MODERATE)\n\n(2) **Projects (项目)**:\n- **National R&D Project (2024)**: Shandong University is a participating institution in a National Key R&D Program titled \"Research on the Preparation and Application of Large-Size Nonlinear Optical Crystals and Devices.\" The project involves collaboration with the Chemical Materials Research Institute of CAEP (中物院化工材料研究所). (STRONG)\n\n(3) **Publications (论文)**:\n- **Co-authored Paper (2025)**: A paper published in the journal *Infrared and Laser Engineering* (红外与激光工程), Vol. 54, Issue 3, lists authors from both Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics (山东大学核科学与能源动力学院) and CAEP's Institute of Fluid Physics (中国工程物理研究院流体物理研究所). (STRONG)\n\n(4) **Events (活动)**:\n- **Recruitment Fair (2021)**: As mentioned under Personnel, CAEP held a dedicated talent symposium and recruitment fair at Shandong University on October 12, 2021, indicating a formal, recurring institutional relationship focused on talent pipelines. (STRONG)\n- **Conference Participation (2024)**: The \"First International Conference on Digital and Intelligent Nuclear Energy\" held in Beijing in November 2024 included participation from both Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics and the China Academy of Engineering Physics. (MODERATE)\n\n(5) **Funding (资金)**:\n- No specific evidence of direct financial transfers was found, but the joint participation in the National Key R&D Program implies shared government funding for the collaborative project. (WEAK)\n\n(6) **Media (媒体)**:\n- No significant media reports discussing the institutions in a joint risk-related context were found.\n\n(7) **Organizations (组织)**:\n- **Innovation Alliance (2010)**: Shandong University and the Machinery Manufacturing Technology Research Institute of CAEP (中物院机械制造工艺研究所) were both founding members of the \"High-speed and High-efficiency Machining Process and Equipment Technology Innovation Alliance,\" initiated by Xi'an Jiaotong University in October 2010.
