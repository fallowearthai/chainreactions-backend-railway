{"result":"Risk Item: 中国工程物理研究院\\nInstitution A: 山东大学核科学与能源动力学院\\nRelationship Type: Direct\\nFinding Summary: Analysis of available information reveals direct connections between Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics and the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), primarily through personnel ties and recruitment activities.\n\n(1) **Personnel (人员)**: \n- **Zhang Peng (张鹏)**: A researcher at the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics, Shandong University, previously worked at the Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry of the China Academy of Engineering Physics. He gave an oral report on his research while affiliated with CAEP. This establishes a direct personnel link between the two institutions. **(STRONG)**\n\n(2) **Projects (项目)**: \n- No specific joint research projects or collaborations were identified in the search results.\n\n(3) **Publications (论文)**: \n- No co-authored publications were found between researchers from both institutions in the available search results.\n\n(4) **Events (活动)**: \n- **First International Conference on Digital and Intelligent Nuclear Energy (首届数智核能国际交流会)**: While both Shandong University's School of Nuclear Science and Energy Dynamics and the China Academy of Engineering Physics were listed as participating organizations in nuclear industry events, no evidence of direct collaboration or joint organization of this specific event was found. Their mutual participation indicates shared interests and presence in the same professional circles. **(WEAK)**\n\n(5) **Funding (资金)**: \n- No information regarding direct financial ties, grants, or contracts between the two institutions was found.\n\n(6) **Media (媒体)**: \n- No media reports detailing specific collaborations or relationships were identified.\n\n(7) **Organizations (组织)**: \n- **Recruitment**: The China Academy of Engineering Physics lists Shandong University as a source for recruitment, indicating that CAEP targets graduates from the university. A recruitment page for CAEP is hosted on a Shandong University job portal.
