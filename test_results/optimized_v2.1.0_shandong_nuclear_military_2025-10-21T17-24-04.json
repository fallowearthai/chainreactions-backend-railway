{"version":"2.1.0","success":true,"data":{"risk_item":"Military","institution_A":"School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, Shandong University","relationship_type":"Direct","finding_summary":"The School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power is part of Shandong University, which has extensive and direct connections to China's military and defense sector. Shandong University is overseen by the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND), a government body responsible for national defense science and technology innovation and military projects. The university collaborates with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) on nuclear weapons development, with CAEP serving as China's national development facility for nuclear warheads and a center for nuclear weapons research. Shandong University hosts several defense laboratories linked to China's nuclear weapons program and is designated as a 'university with national defense characteristics' by SASTIND, indicating its involvement in defense technology training and research, and cooperation with defense companies. Furthermore, the School of Nuclear Science and Energy Power, Shandong University, has circulated notifications regarding 'national defense research plan projects' from SASTIND, inviting faculty to participate in research directions such as anti-radiation electronic devices and related defense technologies. Shandong University also has a 'Science and Technology Innovation Military-Civil Fusion Research Institute' (科技创新军民融合研究院), aligning with China's national strategy of military-civil fusion. In 2016, a signing ceremony took place between the National University of Defense Technology and Shandong University to establish a base for recruiting postgraduate defense students, demonstrating a direct link in military talent cultivation.","potential_intermediary_B":"State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND);
