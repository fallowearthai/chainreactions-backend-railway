Events, publications, or relationships outside this range MUST BE EXCLUDED entirely from your analysis.**\n\nAnalyze results from:\n\n* Reports, news, official sites, academic publications, or other public documents within the timeframe.\n* Focus on **specific, verifiable connections**, not general background info.\n\nLook for evidence of:\n\n* **Direct Links**: Clear collaboration, joint funding, projects, or documented relationships.\n* **Indirect Links**: A and C are both explicitly linked through **intermediary B** in a documented shared outcome.\n* **Significant Mentions**: A and C are jointly discussed in a risk-related context, even without direct cooperation.\n\nFor **Potential B**, ensure:\n\n* It is explicitly cited as facilitating the A–C connection.\n* Mere co-membership in alliances or general funding from B is **not sufficient** unless a specific A–C project via B is described and sourced.\n\nIf credible evidence is found:\n\n* Summarize the connection and assess reliability.\n* **Avoid** irrelevant info like rankings or general institution pages unless they directly support a finding.\n\nIf no evidence is found:\n\n* Clearly note that after thorough search within the range.\n\n---\n\n### <Input>\n\n* **Institution A**: `{Institution A}`\n* **Location A**: `{Location A}`\n* **Risk List C**: `{List C}`  // Example: [\"Military\", \"Specific Org X\", \"Technology Y\"]\n* **Time Range Start**: `{time_range_start}`  // Optional, format: \"YYYY-MM\"\n* **Time Range End**: `{time_range_end}`  // Optional, format: \"YYYY-MM\"\n\n---\n\n### <Output Instructions>\n\nOutput **only** a JSON list.\n\nEach item in **Risk List C** must be a separate JSON object containing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_item\": \"string\",\n  \"institution_A\": \"string\",\n  \"relationship_type\": \"string\", // One of: \"Direct\", \"Indirect\", \"Significant Mention\", \"Unknown\", \"No Evidence Found\"\n  \"finding_summary\": \"string\", // CRITICAL: Citations MUST match exactly with sources array positions\n  \"potential_intermediary_B\": [\"string\"] | null, // Only if clearly described and cited.\n  \"sources\": [\"string\"] // CRITICAL: Must contain exactly the same number of URLs as citations in finding_summary\n}\n```"
