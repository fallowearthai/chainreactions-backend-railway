{"result":"Risk Item: military\\nInstitution A: Henan University\\nRelationship Type: Direct, Indirect\\nFinding Summary: Henan University demonstrates multiple connections to military-related activities and national defense within the specified timeframe (2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31). The university regularly conducts military training for its new students, a common practice in Chinese universities aimed at instilling military discipline and skills. For example, in September 2023, the university held a summary and commendation conference for its 2023 freshman military training across its three campuses, showcasing military exercises and discipline. Similarly, in September 2024, the Henan University School of Music announced the commencement of military training for its 2024 freshmen, emphasizing the development of military qualities.\n\nFurthermore, Henan University faculty members are actively involved in national defense research projects. Dr. Chen Cong from the School of Artificial Intelligence has participated in several 'National Defense National-level Projects' and 'National Defense National-level Key Projects' with specific timelines falling within 2020-2024. These include research on 'XX Platform XXXX Mechanism and Technology' (2020-11 to 2023-11), 'Basic Problems of Simultaneous and Same-frequency XX Network' (2021-8 to 2023-2), 'Unmanned X Swarm XXX Anti-interference Technology' (2021-11 to 2022-12), 'Electronic Countermeasures XXXX' (2022-8 to 2024-7), 'XXXX Interference Suppression Mechanism' (2023-11 to 2024-11), and 'Unmanned Swarm XXXX Adaptive Networking Technology' (2022-1 to 2025-11). The School of Artificial Intelligence's Information Fusion Team also indicates involvement in 'National Defense 973 Project topics' and 'major/key pre-research projects' related to aerospace and missile intelligence.\n\nHenan University also actively supports military conscription and recruitment efforts. On December 27, 2024, the university held a '2024 Conscription Work Summary and Commendation Conference and 2025 Conscription Work Mobilization Conference.' During this event, the Kaifeng City Shunhe District People's Armed Forces Department commended Henan University's consistent support for conscription, highlighting the university's contribution to the 'strong army strategy' and 'modern national defense construction' by encouraging students to join the military.\n\nFinally, the university has established strategic cooperation in military-civil fusion. On September 8, 2024, Henan University's School of Physical Education signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement with the 'All-Army Military Training Medical Research Institute.' This collaboration, termed a 'Military-Civil Fusion New Model,' aims to promote the innovative development of military training medicine and sports disciplines through resource sharing and complementary strengths.\\nIntermediary B: None","urls":"1. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFiC5vgAgPhHlkAy4Hax9RDdtFTNiAGwP5qdtbXiavF0dwHf4V846LmVLBXtGS0vCXxVdGltF7EkynC7BL2C-ImltOTMr5AI8RB2QbfAUs1YlnfZlfKbaM2K4fCA0rwqT9yS3GUT8v44A==\\n2. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHMU5yuemJ01H7kI5hCvjGS5APLjli31SJsP40xHOJiYEg1s8A_h0kRT2nOTCA0l7bW5Zb8MhxnvC9EolJ42J7_hTMmbXXwoBXbGGkIm2ZbDr8YDhCWSOlEA27qF3SNEWiRq0Hc\\n3. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGxUUAAUhnSzbmJVCAmAC54mVFmIS5cFBmqc86p_0XCn37YijIqNkyQBYg7hBW-4X_4LEdTBWLQtpuW_0ekUG3TY7q6y0jF9rxQ4bxfvMe6HVpVt7kzpreuKUExcjTtHwAZK_w_\\n4. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHeYxhWLhQEKU5wV31ePUmy-XhNLqatOAxQDIDI5t77rQVhFi_D_aGrckgCR-Tz1XFOXfWf3cXtFssnwhENPW4v9enHLWGpl5wEgu8KlG9iMS_xQbGH768jIChZji8cVg==\\n5. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFK609HkxjesnoJBnnGLbrlM8Ore8VkRw8HpDNDWwDGkRNCExnQwvuuTEMFZnbkHBNWCr61quMT4x06FrqQ5I-tZz8Xg_yfTF3Q9TIINyCtvrRd5Ve8QuzCQm7e7yYImZPc2Ziaeg==\\n6. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHEo-rdT1kkPslX4Hu1uu2_DSIljlGIynOvAo44je0zgT-OeuI82Xrv1W4GFvj898n74_DiQrHD2kBNQQaBHks3_h0NgMBhXTgh1ZIrontKp76oHE9OyVPqS7K0l43U7anrq4ql0w==\\n7. https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFo3IOe0umnKqcyHRuRwxfFEmXCzTa75FHRGOrXWqUVHQs0WreeOmOi2xRssOqA6bYcEpJA3YbTyRbvVuyYRkDzHKzt02YsP68zlFI28HVA23NH9PC1NZGylY6Tf_lWHmwniZfGNA==","raw_data":{"risk_item":"military","institution_A":"Henan University","relationship_type":"Direct, Indirect","finding_summary":"Henan University demonstrates multiple connections to military-related activities and national defense within the specified timeframe (2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31).
