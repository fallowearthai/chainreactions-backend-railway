The university operates a \"People's Armed Force College\" (人民武装学院), which was established under the co-supervision of the Henan Provincial Military Command and Henan University. This academy provides paramilitary management and basic military training to its students, with the explicit goal of fostering individuals with the \"fine quality of soldiers\". The unveiling ceremony for this academy in June 2001 was attended by leaders from the Provincial Military Command.\n\nFurthermore, in January 2005, the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Henan University formally signed an agreement for the joint training of military cadres (国防生). Under this agreement, selected students receive military-political training and an annual national defense scholarship of 5000 yuan.\n\nMore recently, Henan University's \"Military-Civil Fusion Application Technology Research Institute\" (军民融合应用技术研究院) was designated as one of the first batch of 10 Henan Provincial Military-Civil Fusion Development Think Tanks by the Henan Provincial Party Committee Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee Office. This highlights the university's direct involvement in military-civil fusion strategies and research. In September 2024, the General Military Training Medical Research Institute (全军军事训练医学研究所) and Henan University's School of Physical Education signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement to promote innovation in military training medicine and sports disciplines.\n\nThe university also has a People's Armed Forces Department (人民武装部) and a conscription work station (征兵工作站) responsible for student recruitment into the military. It actively integrates national defense education into its curriculum, including military training for students, and collaborates with various military units, such as the Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, Airborne 128th Brigade, Kaifeng Military Sub-district, and Armed Police Kaifeng Detachment, as \"national defense education co-construction units\". Additionally, in 2016, Henan University was approved as a \"Henan Province Military Transfer Cadre Training Base,\" providing training for military officers transitioning to civilian roles and vocational skills training for demobilized soldiers.",

      "finding_summary": "Henan University, as one of the universities in Henan Province, is directly implicated in human rights violations related to religious freedom and academic autonomy. As recently as February 2025, reports indicate that \"Henan Universities\" (plural) have forced students to record anti-religion videos as a \"political task,\" persecuting those who refuse. This includes mandatory attendance at anti-religion meetings, requirements to hand over phones, and prohibitions on photography, video recording, or online discussion of these meetings. Students whose videos are deemed unsatisfactory face further investigation, and dozens have reportedly experienced various forms of persecution. Universities are described as collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to investigate Christian students through these anti-religion videos.\n\nFurthermore, in July 2017, new regulations in Henan province, announced by the provincial departments of education, public security, and foreign affairs, subjected international students attending universities in the province to censorship of their religious beliefs. These regulations banned students from practicing religious beliefs on campus and mandated courses in political theory, Chinese law, culture, and customs, effectively prohibiting religious gatherings or preaching on school property. These measures were identified as a \"severe violation of Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China\". As a prominent university in Henan, Henan University would be subject to and implement these provincial directives.\n\nHistorically, Henan University has also been subject to significant political interference. In 1949, the Henan Provincial People's Government, under Chairman Wu Zhipu, \"suppressed and split\" Henan University for \"various political reasons\". Earlier, during the Chinese Civil War in 1948, the university faced political pressure, with its president, Yao Congwu, being compelled to relocate the institution south, leading to a split among its faculty and students. This demonstrates a long-standing pattern of direct state and political control over the university's operations and academic freedom.",

This academy, unveiled in June 2001 with attendance from provincial military leaders, provides paramilitary management and basic military training to its students, who have also participated in and won military training performances for college students.

In June 2024, the university hosted an \"Advanced Technology Achievement Matching Activity\" organized by the Henan Provincial Party Committee's Military-Civil Fusion Office. This event aimed to facilitate the transfer of the university's scientific and technological innovations, particularly in new materials, information technology, and intelligent manufacturing, to foster \"new quality productive forces\" and support technological self-reliance, which often includes dual-use technologies applicable to defense.\n\nIn January 2005, the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) formally signed an agreement with Henan University for the joint training of military officers. As part of this program, national defense students (国防生) at Henan University received military and political training, including military psychology, military law, military leadership science, and basic military skills, along with an annual national defense scholarship from the military.
