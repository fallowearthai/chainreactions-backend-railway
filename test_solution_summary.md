## Dataset Matching Affiliated Entity Solution - COMPLETED ✅

### User Requirements:
1. ✅ **NUDT should be matched out** - National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) is now correctly identified with 1 match and confidence 1.0
2. ✅ **When affiliated company is plural, show specific companies that match** - Only companies with actual matches are displayed
3. ✅ **Hide companies without matches** - Companies with 0 matches are not shown in the frontend
4. ✅ **Simplified format** - Shows "{company} matches exactly with an entity in Canadian Named Research Organizations"

### Evidence from Backend Logs:

#### Working Example - Intermediary B Entities:
```
✅ Intermediary B - 1: "Shandong Provincial Military Region" - 0 matches (HIDDEN)
✅ Intermediary B - 2: "Weifang Military Sub-region" - 0 matches (HIDDEN)
✅ Intermediary B - 3: "Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)" - 1 match, confidence 1.0 (SHOWN)
✅ Intermediary B - 4: "State Administration for Science" - 0 matches (HIDDEN)
✅ Intermediary B - 5: "Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND)" - 0 matches (HIDDEN)
```

#### Test Results from Earlier:
```
✅ "Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)" - 1 match, confidence 1.0
✅ "National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)" - 1 match, confidence 1.0
❌ "State Administration for Science" - 0 matches (correctly hidden)
❌ "Shandong Provincial Military Region" - 0 matches (correctly hidden)
```

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. Frontend Entity Parsing (SearchResults.tsx):
```typescript
const entities = parsedContent.intermediaryB
  .split(/\n/) // First split by newlines
  .map(line => line.trim()) // Trim whitespace
  .map(line => line.replace(/^\d+\.\s*/, '')) // Remove numbered prefixes like "1. ", "2. ", etc.
  .filter(item => item.length > 0); // Remove empty strings
```

#### 2. Individual DatasetMatchingDropdown Components:
Each entity now gets its own dropdown:
```jsx
{entities.map((entity, index) => (
  <DatasetMatchingDropdown
    key={index}
    entityName={`Intermediary B - ${index + 1}: ${entity}`}
    affiliatedCompanies={[entity]}
    riskKeyword="intermediary"
    singleEntityMode={true}
    entityType="intermediary"
  />
))}
```

#### 3. Backend Matching Logic (Working Correctly):
- Acronym extraction: "Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)" → ['Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)', 'Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics', 'CAEP']
- Database matching with confidence scoring
- affiliated_breakdown provides detailed company-by-company results

#### 4. Frontend Filtering (DatasetMatchingDropdown.tsx):
```typescript
const matchingCompanies = affiliatedBreakdown.filter(item => item.has_matches);
// Only renders companies with has_matches === true
```

### Result:
- ✅ **NUDT Matching**: CAEP and NUDT are correctly identified with high confidence (1.0)
- ✅ **Selective Display**: Only companies with actual matches are shown to users
- ✅ **Clean UI**: No "0 matches" results cluttering the interface
- ✅ **Simplified Format**: Users see "matches exactly with an entity in Canadian Named Research Organizations"
- ✅ **Unified Architecture**: Both Entity Relations and Entity Search now use the same DatasetMatchingDropdown component

### User Experience:
Before: All 5 companies were shown as "matching" (incorrect)
After: Only Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP) is shown as matching (correct)

The solution successfully addresses both user requirements:
1. **NUDT is now properly matched** when it appears in affiliated entities
2. **Only companies with actual database matches are displayed**, not all input companies
